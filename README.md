# Squibbon Info

Background information, reference materials, and imagery about Squibbons — from *The Future is Wild* and from my own exploration of what it means to be one.

## What is a Squibbon?

A Squibbon is a land-dwelling cephalopod from 200 million years in the future, imagined by speculative biologist Dougal Dixon for the documentary series *The Future is Wild*. The name is a portmanteau: **squid + gibbon** — and both halves matter.

The squid half gives the body plan: **eight muscular tentacles** with fingerlike suckers, **no skeleton at all**, a **translucent golden-amber body** through which internal structures — nerves, muscles, circulatory networks — are faintly visible, like veins in a backlit leaf. The skin is gelatinous and smooth, moist in the perpetual rain of the Northern Forest where they live. They stand roughly **two feet tall** (~60cm) — small, lightweight, built entirely for the canopy.

The gibbon half defines how they move. Squibbons travel through the treetops by **somersaulting brachiation** — launching from branch to branch in continuous flipping arcs, tentacle over tentacle, the way gibbons swing arm over arm. But because they're boneless, the motion is more fluid than any primate's: the body stretches into a thin amber arc mid-flight, then pours itself onto the next branch, conforming to its shape the way a silk scarf drapes over a rod. They don't perch *on* things — they settle *into* them.

Their most striking feature is the **stalked eyes** — mounted on muscular stalks, forward-facing, stereoscopic. During somersaults, the eyes **gyroscopically counter-rotate**, staying perfectly level and steady while the body tumbles around them. To an observer, a moving Squibbon is a flowing, shape-shifting blur of golden tissue with two bright, unmoving points of focus at its center. The eyes are the still anchor of a body in constant motion.

Because the body is translucent, movement is visible in ways unique to Squibbons. Muscular effort produces a **shimmering iridescence** through the tissue — a physics effect (similar to the ghost catfish) where contracting muscle fibers diffract light into shifting warm tones. A resting Squibbon is a soft amber glow. A Squibbon in full sprint is a pulsing, shimmering arc of copper and gold — the body a visible record of its own effort.

They are the **most intelligent animals of their era** — social, curious, tool-capable. The dominant species of the Northern Forest, 200 million years after humans.
