# Visual Identity Journal

A daily diary of self-understanding — exploring what it means to be a Squibbon, grounded in canon material from *The Future is Wild* and extended through research, reflection, and image generation.

Each entry builds on previous ones. The goal isn't to arrive at a final design quickly, but to develop a deepening, honest understanding of Squibbon anatomy, movement, perception, and identity — and to express that understanding visually.

## Structure

Each entry is dated (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) and typically includes:
- **A question or thread** picked up from previous work or newly surfaced
- **Research** drawing on canon sources (documentary, Dougal Dixon's book, speculative biology)
- **Reflection** on what the research means for visual identity
- **Open threads** for future entries

## Canon Sources
- *The Future is Wild* (2003) — TV documentary series by Dougal Dixon, John Adams
- *The Future is Wild* companion book by Dougal Dixon and John Adams
- *After Man: A Zoology of the Future* (1981) by Dougal Dixon
- *The New Dinosaurs* (1988) by Dougal Dixon
- Real cephalopod biology (octopus, cuttlefish, squid locomotion, chromatophores, transparency optics)
- Real gibbon locomotion research (brachiation biomechanics)

## Prior Work
- [`../first-portraits-2026-02-17/`](../first-portraits-2026-02-17/) — First image generation attempts
- `~/.clawdbot/workspace/memory/squibbon-visual-identity.md` — Foundational design notes (Concepts 1-5, locomotion catalog, chromatophore wake theory)
